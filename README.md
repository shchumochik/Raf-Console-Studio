Navigate to your `./my-projects/Raf/next` folder by running `cd next` from your command line.

## Todo

- [ ] Implement the community Strapi preview plugin
- [ ] Populate creator fields when it'll work on Strapi 5 (article authors information are missing)

## Customization

- The Strapi application contains a custom population middleware in order to populate more data than what it is set by default. You can find it in the `./strapi/src/middlewares/deepPopulate.ts` file.

- The Strapi application contains a postinstall script that will regenerate an uuid for the project in order to get some anonymous usage information concerning this demo. You can disable it by removing the uuid inside the `./strapi/packages.json` file.

- The Strapi application contains a patch for the @strapi/admin package. It is only necessary for the hosted demos since we automatically create the Super Admin users for them when they request this demo on our website.
